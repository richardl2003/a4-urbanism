## How to run the product

### Without Make
To generate an irregular mesh with 1000 polygons, enter this into the terminal:
```
cd generator 
cd generator && java -jar generator.jar -m irregular -r 100 -p 1000 -o sample.mesh
```

To generate an island with cities, enter this into the terminal
```
cd island 
cd island && java -jar island.jar -i ../generator/sample.mesh -o lagoon.mesh -shape <> -cities 35 -network star -visual city -aquifer <> -lake <> -river <> -soil <> -biomes <>
```
Note: aquifers, lakes, rivers, biomes, soil, and shape are all arbitrary, for more info go to [Island.md](./island/island.md) for information on CLI inputs

Finally, to visualize, enter this into the terminal
```
cd visualizer
java -jar visualizer.jar -m ../generator/sample.mesh -o sample.svg
```

### With Make (Has scenarios)
A `makefile` has been provided to easily create meshes 
* To create an irregular mesh:
  * `make run-irregular-relaxed`

* To generate an island with cities:
  * `make island-cities`
  * `make island-cities-seed`

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run (while in A2):
```
mvn clean install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

# A4 - Mesh Generation

## How to run cities (Give overview on CLI options, and Make file stuff)
* CLI options affecting cities:
  * -cities, indicates number of cities to display on island
  * -network, indciates how the cities will connect with each other (star vs non-star)
  * if you use -cities, MUST use -network because they are dependent on each other

## Rationale

Purpose of the new module `pathfinder` is to simulate settlements and urbanism development of islands.
 
## Explanation for extending the library by implementing a new algorithm

An island is a collection of vertices and segments. These vertices and edges can be mapped as a Graph:
- Vertices -> nodes
- Segments -> edges

With a collection of vertices and segments, we can solve interesting problems, such as determining the shortest path between nodes

## Design Choices related to City generation 

* Cities were chosen as centroids
  * Did not choose the hull vertices
  * Exponentially more vertices than polygons in the mesh
  * This is because every polygon is made up of at least 4-5 vertices, but every polyon only has 1 centroid
* Roads connected centroids together
  * Roads and rivers are dual
  * Since my rivers followed the segments, the roads must be paths between centroids
  * This is because roads can cross rivers, but not lakes as it would be too costly

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

## Module Information

Check [Island.md](./island/island.md), [Generator.md](./generator/generator.md), [Visualizer.md](./visualizer/visualizer.md), and [Pathfinder.md](./pathfinder/pathfinder.md) for more in depth information, such as geometry properties, command line args, and whittaker diagram information.


### Definition of Done

* Feature is permanently completed with consideration of edge cases. 
* Code is either readable, commented, or documented. 
* Code passes all tests.
